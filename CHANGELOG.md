## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-XX - NDK Warnings Resolution

### Fixed
- **NDK Duplicate Package Warnings** - Resolved Android SDK Manager warnings about duplicate NDK package IDs
- **Inconsistent Location Warnings** - Eliminated warnings about NDK packages found in inconsistent locations
- **SDK Manager Detection** - Fixed duplicate detection of NDK versions 27.3.13750724 and 26.3.11579264

### Changed
- **NDK Installation Structure** - Removed symbolic links `/sdk/ndk/latest` and `/sdk/ndk/previous` that were causing duplicate package detection
- **Canonical NDK Paths** - NDK installations now exist only in their canonical locations (`/sdk/ndk/27.3.13750724` and `/sdk/ndk/26.3.11579264`)
- **Documentation** - Updated Dockerfile comments to reflect removal of symbolic links

### Added
- **NDK Validation Check** - Added SDK Manager validation during Docker build to detect and prevent NDK warnings
- **Clean Build Verification** - Ensure builds complete without package location warnings

### Migration Guide
- No changes required for existing CI configurations
- NDK access should use canonical paths instead of symbolic links:
  - Use `/sdk/ndk/27.3.13750724` instead of `/sdk/ndk/latest`
  - Use `/sdk/ndk/26.3.11579264` instead of `/sdk/ndk/previous`
- Environment variable `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` continues to point to NDK 27.3.13750724

## [3.1.0] - 2025-08-12 - Docker Build Fix and Resilience Improvements

### Fixed
- **Docker Build Failure** - Resolved constraint-layout package installation error that was causing build failures at step 9/15
- **Obsolete Package Removal** - Removed deprecated `extras;m2repository;com;android;support;constraint;constraint-layout;1.0.2` package
- **Build Resilience** - Added error handling to make builds more resilient to network connectivity issues during SDK package installation
- **Gradle Installation** - Fixed Gradle directory structure to ensure proper PATH configuration
- **NDK Installation** - Made NDK package installation optional with graceful fallback when network issues occur

### Changed
- **Constraint Layout Approach** - Constraint Layout is now handled as a Gradle dependency rather than an SDK package (AndroidX migration)
- **Error Handling** - SDK package installation now continues with warnings instead of failing completely on network issues
- **Build Process** - More robust build process that can handle temporary network connectivity issues

### Added
- **Documentation Updates** - Added guidance on using constraint-layout as a Gradle dependency in README.md
- **Network Resilience** - Build can now complete successfully even if some non-critical packages fail to download
- **Improved Error Messages** - Better error reporting and fallback mechanisms for network-related issues

### Migration Guide
- If using constraint-layout, add it as a Gradle dependency: `implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'`
- No other changes required - existing CI configurations will continue to work
- Build process is now more resilient to network issues in CI environments
